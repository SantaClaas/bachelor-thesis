	abstract = {Accessibility auditors have to choose a method when evaluating accessibility: expert review (a.k.a. conformance testing), user testing, subjective evaluations, barrier walkthrough are some possibilities. However, little is known to date about their relative strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, what happened for usability evaluation methods is likely to repeat for accessibility: that there is uncertainty about not only pros and cons of methods, but also about criteria to be used to compare them and metrics to measure these criteria. After a quick review and description of methods, the paper illustrates a comparative test of two web accessibility evaluation methods: conformance testing and barrier walkthrough. The comparison aims at determining merits of barrier walkthrough, using conformance testing as a control condition. A comparison framework is outlined, followed by the description of a laboratory experiment with 12 subjects (novice accessibility evaluators), and its results. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found in terms of correctness, one of the several metrics used to compare the methods. Reliability also appears to be diﬀerent.},

	abstract = {An end-user questionnaire to measure user experience quickly in a simple and immediate way while covering a preferably comprehensive impression of the product user experience was the goal of the reported construction process. An empirical approach for the item selection was used to ensure practical relevance of items. Usability experts collected terms and statements on user experience and usability, including ‘hard’ as well as ‘soft’ aspects. These statements were consolidated and transformed into a first questionnaire version containing 80 bipolar items. It was used to measure the user experience of software products in several empirical studies. Data were subjected to a factor analysis which resulted in the construction of a 26 item questionnaire including the six factors Attractiveness, Perspicuity, Efficiency, Dependability, Stimulation, and Novelty. Studies conducted for the original German questionnaire and an English version indicate a satisfactory level of reliability and construct validity.},

We measured accessibility in two ways: the perceived accessibility as reported by participants and accessibility in terms of conformance to guidelines. Findings uncover that perceived Web accessibility is signiﬁcantly correlated with 27 of the 35 {UX} attributes analysed, suggesting these two qualities are closely related. The relationship between {UX} and conformance to {WCAG} 2.0 is more elusive: we only found signiﬁcant correlations between the hedonic attributes original, innovative and exciting.},

As long as beauty and goodness stress the subjective valuation of a product, both were related to each other. However, the nature of goodness and beauty was found to differ. Goodness depended on both perceived usability and hedonic attributes. Especially after using the skins, perceived usability became a strong determinant of goodness. In contrast, beauty largely depended on identification; a hedonic attribute group, which captures the product’s ability to communicate important personal values to relevant others. Perceived usability as well as goodness was affected by experience (i.e., actual usability, usability problems), whereas hedonic attributes and beauty remained stable over time. All in all, the nature of beauty is rather self-oriented than goal-oriented, whereas goodness relates to both.},

In addition, different possible relationships could exist between problems encountered by disabled and nondisabled users, yet little empirical data have been gathered on this question. Guidelines for accessibility and usability of websites provide ratings of the importance of problems for users, yet little empirical data have been gathered to validate these ratings. A study investigated the accessibility of two websites with 6 disabled (blind) and 6 non-disabled (sighted) people. Problems encountered by the two groups comprised two intersecting sets, with approximately 15\% overlap. For one of the two websites, blind people rated problems significantly more severely than sighted people. There was high agreement between participants as to the severity of problems, and agreement between participants and researchers. However, there was no significant agreement between either participants or researchers and the importance/priority ratings provided by accessibility and usability guidelines. Practical and theoretical implications of these results are discussed.},

In this paper, we report a survey that gathered the views on {UX} of 275 researchers and practitioners from academia and industry. Most respondents agree that {UX} is dynamic, context-dependent, and subjective. With respect to the more controversial issues, the authors propose to delineate {UX} as something individual (instead of social) that emerges from interacting with a product, system, service or an object. The draft {ISO} definition on {UX} seems to be in line with the survey findings, although the issues of experiencing anticipated use and the object of {UX} will require further explication. The outcome of this survey lays ground for understanding, scoping, and defining the concept of user experience.},

We next present the main ideas underlying the Object-Oriented Hypermedia Design Method ({OOHDM}). We show that Web applications are built as views of conceptual models. We next present the abstraction primitives we use to design the conceptual and navigational structure of Web applications and describe the view definition language.

	abstract = {Purpose
              After being implemented for two years, {HKBUtube} (the official video streaming site developed by Hong Kong Baptist University Library) has become a popular source of videos for the university. This video site also begins to draw the attention of the community. When more libraries are starting to respond to the demand for mobile service, the {HKBU} Library decided not to remain aloof. Before committing itself to the provision of an additional platform, the Library carried out a proof of concept to investigate the likelihood of library users watching videos via a mobile app when the web counterpart was available. This paper aims to investigate this issue.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Through building a small‐scale mobile app to showcase and display videos, this paper studies the use of the app and the popularity of watching videos via smartphones. To yield a more accurate result, a web counterpart was also developed for comparison of usage.
            
            
              Findings
              The data suggest that the usage between the app and website version was about the same. This study also demonstrates the power of Apple's marketing support, the large group of international users, and the effect of broadband speeds.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Usage data presented in this paper support the importance of the provision of mobile video collections. This paper also offers practical information that can assist academic libraries in justifying and developing mobile services, in particular mobile media collections.},
